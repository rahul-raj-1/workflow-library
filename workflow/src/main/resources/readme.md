# Potential Features for Workflow System

The following are potential features that could be added to a workflow system:

- **Error Handling:** Add support for error handling, such as the ability to catch and handle errors that occur during workflow execution.

- **Retry Logic:** Implement retry logic for failed steps or entire workflows, with customizable retry parameters such as number of attempts and time between attempts.

- **Parallel Execution:** Enable parallel execution of steps to improve workflow performance.

- **Conditional Branching:** Add support for conditional branching within the workflow, allowing certain steps to be executed based on the outcome of previous steps.

- **Pause/Resume Execution:** Allow for pausing and resuming of workflows and individual steps during execution.

- **Workflow Notifications:** Allow for notifications to be sent via email, SMS, or other channels when a workflow execution fails or succeeds.

- **Workflow Versioning:** Enable versioning of workflows, allowing multiple versions to be maintained and executed as needed.

- **Dynamic Workflow Composition:** Allow for dynamic composition of workflows based on runtime data or conditions.

- **Step Timeout:** Add the ability to set timeouts for individual steps to prevent long-running steps from blocking workflow execution.

- **Step Dependencies:** Enable setting dependencies between steps, so that certain steps cannot be executed until others have completed successfully.

- **Step Pre- and Post-Execution Hooks:** Add support for executing custom logic before and after step execution.

- **Step Retries:** Implement retry logic for individual steps that fail, with customizable retry parameters.

- **Step Rollback:** Add support for rolling back steps that have already been executed in the event of a failure.

- **Step Skipped Logic:** Implement logic for skipping steps based on conditions such as previous step output or context data.

- **Step Status and Metrics:** Track and report on the status and metrics of individual steps during workflow execution.

- **Step Prioritization:** Enable prioritization of steps based on business rules or other criteria.

- **Step Parallelism:** Allow for steps to be executed in parallel, with customizable parallelism settings such as number of threads.

- **Step Cancellation:** Add the ability to cancel execution of individual steps or entire workflows.

- **Step Execution Context:** Provide access to execution context for each step, including inputs, outputs, and status.

- **Step Monitoring:** Add support for real-time monitoring of step execution, with alerts and notifications for potential issues.

- **Step Time Travel:** Allow for rewinding and replaying of individual steps or entire workflows for debugging or auditing purposes.

- **Step Rollforward:** Add support for rolling forward steps that were skipped or failed in a previous execution.

- **Step Concurrency Control:** Implement concurrency controls for steps to prevent data integrity issues or conflicts.

- **Step Visualization:** Provide a visual representation of workflows and step execution for easier debugging and monitoring.

- **Step Debugging:** Enable step-level debugging for easier troubleshooting and issue resolution.

- **Step Authorization:** Add support for role-based access control to restrict access to steps based on user roles or permissions.

- **Step Customization:** Allow for customization of steps or entire workflows based on business rules or other criteria.
